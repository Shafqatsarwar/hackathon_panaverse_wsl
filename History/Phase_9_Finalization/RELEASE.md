# Phase 9: Finalization & PWA 📦

**Focus**: Preparation for Hand-off/Demo.

## 1. PWA (Progressive Web App)
- **Goal**: Make the app installable.
- **Action**: Added `manifest.json`.
- **Result**: Users can "Install" the assistant to their desktop/home screen.

## 2. Documentation Overhaul
- **Action**: Consolidated scattered instructions into `INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- **Created**: This comprehensive `History/` folder structure.

## 3. GitHub Prep
Cleaned `.gitignore` to ensure secrets (`.env`, sessions) are NOT committed.

## 4. Final Verification
- Restarted all services.
- Verified "Trinity" (Email, WA, LinkedIn) are active.
