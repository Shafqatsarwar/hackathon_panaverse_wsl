# Phase 8: The Documentation Engine 📚

**Focus**: Leaving a legacy.

## 1. The "Consolidation"
- **Task**: Merge scattered files.
- **Action**: Merged `CREDENTIALS.md` into `INSTRUCTIONS.md` to create a "Single Source of Truth" for setup.

## 2. The "Developer Guide"
- **Task**: Explain the "Why" and "How".
- **Action**: Rewrote `GUIDE.md` to be architectural (Folders, Agents, Tech Stack) rather than just procedural.

## 3. The "Historical Archive" (This Folder)
- **Task**: Document the journey.
- **Action**: Created `History/` with phases 1-9 to map the entire lifecycle for future developers (and Judges) to see the evolution.
    - Capturing Prompts (`USER_PROMPTS.md`).
    - Recording Decisions (`ADR/`).
